# 5-Qubit-Code-with-Pauli-Error
This repo contains my work constructing the perfect $[[5,1,3]]$ quantum error correcting code, along with simulations in which random error is introduced to the circuit and corrections are applied according to syndrome measurements. 

First I define the function logical_state(x) outputs the logical state $|x_L\rangle$ for choice of $x\in \{0,1\}$. Note that the code this function depends on can easily be modified to generate logical states for any $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum error correcting code. Next, I define the syndrome_extraction_circuit(x) function, which prepares the state $|x_L\rangle$ and constructs the circuit corresponding to the $[[5,1,3]]$ code with syndrome measurements. The function is then updated twice; the first update is called syndrome_extraction_and_correction_circuit(x) and after measuring the syndromes, it implements the corresponding gate correction (which can be found in the paper "Perfect Quantum Error Correction Code" by R. Laflamme et al.); the second update is called syndrome_extraction_and_correction_circuit_with_error(x,p), which runs the circuit (after preparing the logical state and prior to syndrome measurements) though a random Pauli error channel (with probability for each gate error equal to $p\leq \frac{1}{3}$). Simulations are then run and visualized for choice of $x$ and $p$.
